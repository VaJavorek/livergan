# livergan - Image Domain Transfer for Liver Analysis in Histology

Using GANs to transform the domain of large microscopic liver images obtained from live samples into a different domain that represents decellularized liver tissue.

<img src="/img/examples/default_A1.png" width="450"/> <img src="/img/examples/default_A2.png" width="450"/> 
<img src="/img/examples/default_B1.png" width="450"/> <img src="/img/examples/default_B2.png" width="450"/>

By bridging this domain gap, we can overcome the constraints of live tissue analysis and unlock new possibilities for comprehensive image-based investigations, for example, using proven analysis tools from the [scaffan](https://github.com/mjirik/scaffan) library in the desired domain and comparing the results of the selected metric.
